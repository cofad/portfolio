My personal website to demonstrate my new found web development skills and provide some background information about me

It includes a brief "About" section with some personal and professional information on it. There's also a "Projects" section which serves to highligth some of the things I worked on in my Tech901 class. I also included a "Games" section which has a few interactive activities to show off my javascript skills.
